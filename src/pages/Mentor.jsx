        <List>
          <li>Start coding(or skill building) early, from the first year try balencing you can see wonders</li>
          <li>Not maintaining CGPA from the first semester(Consitency). One semester with less gpa can spoil overall grage cgpa</li>
          <li>Studying just 1 day before exam, many people does this but in reality there is 1 month duration before exams so just spending 1 week is enough before exams(not 1 day)</li>
          <li>Focused too much on frontend(which is about mostly creativity), ignored backend for a while. Backend is real coding.</li>
          <li>Didn't apply for early internships. During my 3rd year Internships started but didnt start coding until then</li>
